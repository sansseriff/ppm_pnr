abstract = {We consider the problem of tracing the intersection of surfaces given either implicitly or parametrically. We give a numerical tracing procedure in which a third-order Taylor approximant is constructed for taking steps of variable length, and the points so found are improved by Newton iteration. We show how this construction relates to local parametrizations of the curve at singularities, and discuss our experience with the method. For plane curves, given implicitly, we show how desingularization techniques can be incorporated to trace correctly through all types of singularities. An implementation of this method is also discussed.}

In particular, we propose and matrix computations. We present algorithms to compute a start point on each component of the intersection curve (both open and closed components), detect the presence of singularities, and find all the curve branches near the singularity. We also suggest methods to compute the step size during tracing to prevent component jumping. The algorithm runs an order of magnitude faster than previously published robust algorithms. The complexity of the algorithm is output sensitive.},

journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

keywords = {Independent component analysis, Projection pursuit, Blind signal separation, Source separation, Factor analysis, Representation},
abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.}
